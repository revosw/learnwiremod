# Exploring the tool

## In the spawnmenu
Open up the spawnmenu with Q, and have a look at the Wire tab. Under **Chips, Gates** you'll find Expression 2. After selecting the tool, close the spawnmenu and right click to open the editor. Optionally, you can click "Open Editor" from the spawn menu.

## Remote updater settings
In this menu, you can manage your expressions remotely. The feature is very useful if, for example, your expression is far away from you or deep within a contraption and you want to edit it. The menu benefits server admins too, as not all expressions are coded with good intents. Some people who code expressions do everything in their might to be as annoying as possible, playing loud sounds everywhere and trying to crash the server.
