# learnwiremod
A website for learning Wiremod

## Roadmap
These features are what I am trying to implement into the website:

### VitePress
[VitePress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/) is a bleeding edge documentation site generator with built-in [DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/) and lots of other nice features. I have not explored theming or other configuration for VitePress, but it looks very promising.

### Syntax highlighting
VitePress uses Shiki under the hood to highlight languages. TextMate grammar must be written to properly support highlighting e2, spu, gpu, cpu and other languages.

### Quizzing the material
People should understand what they read, quizzing the material at the end of each section helps with that.
