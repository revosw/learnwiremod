# wiremodforall

Making this project because I feel determined

https://revosw.github.io/wiremodforall/e2/introduction.html


## TODO:

* style each guide as their own theme
* Have approximately the same layout for every guide

### Include these things for the e2 guide

* #include
* #ifdef #ifndef #else #endif >> #ifdef only supports built in/extension functions, not UDF (User defined functions)
* ternary operator
* ->Input ->Output

### Things to do outside of the guide

e2 syntax - pull request to highlight.js

//type
(function\s|\[\d+,|:(?!.*\())+
