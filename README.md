The website is under construction, and I've added [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a _really_ fast static website generator

## Hugo?
Hugo is a static website generator (just like Jekyll for those who are familiar with that) - which means that it takes a dynamic template, and applies it to static content. This means that you don't have to spend much energy thinking about the template and learning HTML, but rather just write the content in plain markdown.

## So how do I contribute?
Contributions aren't yet open. [Check the prerequisities](https://github.com/revosw/wiremodforall/projects/1)
