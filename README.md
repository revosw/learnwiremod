# wiremodforall

Making this project because I feel determined

## TODO:

* style each guide as their own theme
* Have the same layout for every guide
* Change topnav's plain text to cool animations that play when you hover over the topics (maybe 24-frame .apng made in After Effects?)

### Include these things for the e2 guide

* #include
* #ifdef #ifndef #else #endif >> #ifdef only supports built in/extension functions, not UDF (User defined functions)
* ternary operator
* ->Input ->Output

### Things to do outside of the guide

e2 syntax - [Pull request](https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js/pull/1558) to highlight.js
