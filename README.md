# learnwiremod
A website for learning Wiremod
# Roadmap
These features are what I am trying to implement into the website:
## Offline experience
Using service workers through the tool [workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/), the website can be fully cached to your computer after the first visit with an internet connection, so you can visit with no internet connection later.
## Syntax highlighting
Using [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/), you can create your own language ruleset and color scheme. There is already a ruleset and color scheme for Expression 2, but not yet for CPU/SPU/GPU.
## Quizzing the material
People should understand what they read. Quizzes help with that. Great stuff.
## Editor with intellisense?
I don't think this is required, but if other features get implemented, this might be considered.
## Illustrating concepts with Three.js
[Three.js](https://threejs.org/) is a 3D graphics library. Maybe I can use it in the tutorial to better show for instance:
* what is pitch, yaw and roll?
* What do the different hologram models look like?
