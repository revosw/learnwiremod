# learnwiremod
A website for learning Wiremod

## Roadmap
These features are what I am trying to implement into the website:

### TailwindCSS
[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) is a utility-first css framework. It lets you style html by composing utility classes such as `py-4` (4px padding in y direction) and `border-2`. This makes styling the website much more comfortable, instead of having to painstakingly handle specificity rules, avoid big tangled classes with bad names and other css issues.

### Scrollspy/gumshoe
A menu on the left that keeps track of where in the document you are. You can click to navigate, and it updates in real time.

### Syntax highlighting
Using [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/), you can create your own language ruleset and color scheme. For now there is a ruleset and color scheme for Expression 2, but not yet for CPU/SPU/GPU.

### Quizzing the material
People should understand what they read. Quizzes help with that. Great stuff.

### Editor with intellisense?
No idea how to implement this. Tried googling if language servers can be run in the browser, but couldn't get any info.
